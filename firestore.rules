/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Home Improvement App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data
 * (users, properties, and projects). Data not directly owned by users is public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. User ID in path must match the user's auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}: Stores property details.  Includes userId for authorization.
 * - /users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}/projects/{projectId}: Stores project details. Includes userId and propertyId for authorization.
 * - /improvement_ideas/{improvementIdeaId}: Stores public improvement ideas.  Publicly readable.
 * - /contractors/{contractorId}: Stores public contractor information. Publicly readable.
 * - /project_contractors/{projectContractorId}: Stores the association between projects and contractors.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only manage properties and projects associated with their account.
 * - Listing of user documents is denied to prevent enumeration.
 * - Improvement ideas and contractors are publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Subcollections like `/users/{userId}/properties/{propertyId}` include the `userId` field within the document itself. This denormalization allows security rules to validate ownership without needing costly `get()` operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data (profiles, properties, projects) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, while public data (improvement ideas, contractors) resides in top-level collections. This separation simplifies security rules and improves query performance.
